<p>Hi World!<p>

<p>I'm Benji. I'm a sociologist from Cordoba, Argentina.<p>

<p>I've been doing research on graffiti. Now I'm soon to finish the writing for my master degree. I'm mostly concerned on de-criminalization of this practice and how we use public space. Here I present my Abstract for the masters degree defense in November, 2014, at UNICAMP, SP-BR. <p>

                    <h2>Urban Art: expressive uses of public space</h2>
                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>There is art in the making of the city. We all are a part of that construction. This work originated from the concern about the stripping of public space: specifically interested in the defiance of urban interventions and other spontaneous inscriptions that appear and endure aside from a pre-planned urban order. Fieldwork focused on the web of relations sustained in and from the city of S&#227o Paulo(SP), and at the same time in communication with artists and scenarios from elsewhere: from other parts of Brazil as well as from LatinAmerica and Europe. A two-fold consideration aproached the art worlds in themselves, as well as the wider social worlds involved in interacting with the environment, and with the people that inhabit and circulate along the streets. The work centered on:<p>

<ul>
<li> Understanding how pixa&#231&#227o became polarized apart from graffiti</li>

<li> Rescuing the heuristic value of the account of an artist</li>

<li> Reviewing the mutations of graffiti from within and outside the art worlds</li>

<li> Etnographing a continually intervened space</li>

<li> Considering decreasing censorship as sign of change in use of public space</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The aim was to contribute elements to analyze how the change in meaning of those interventions affect the environment's atmosphere and the way in which people interact with each other and with the street itself. Some parts of the city stand out by their intensity and the way in which fluxes (of people, of interventions, of means of mobility) circulate. Some of these forces are offered and taken by the powers of capital and authorities. Others are not. In this manner, new forms of inhabiting the city grow, instead of just circulating it from one enclosed space to another.
